
<h1> Dog Years</h1>

<p>
 Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s
  age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a
  human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs
  — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life.</p> 
  
<p>  How old would you be if you were a dog? Here’s how you convert your age from “human years”
  to “dog years”: The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years
  each. Each year following equates to 4 dog years. </p>
 
 <p> Before you start doing the
  math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math
  operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog
  years. </p>
